# The keyword __________ is required to define a class.

# return
# class
# All of the above

# What will get printed after running this code?
# 
# class Account:
# def __init__(self, id):
#     self.id = id
#     id = 666
#     acc = Account(123)
#     print(acc.id)
# None
# 123
# 666
# SyntaxError, this program will not run

# Analyze the following code:
# class A:
#     def __init__(self, s):
#         self.s = s
#         def print(self):
#             print(s)
# a = A("Welcome")
# a.print()
# The program has an error because class A does not have a constructor.
# The program has an error because class A should have a print method with signature print(self, s).
# The program has an error because class A should have a print method with signature print(s).
# The program would run if you change print(s) to print(self.s).

# Given the declaration x = Circle(), which of the following statement is most accurate?
# x contains an int value.
# x contains an object of the Circle type.
# x contains a reference to a Circle object.
# You can assign an int value to x.
